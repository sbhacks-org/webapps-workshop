To see any changes to the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files, just save and refresh the page in the browser. (You may have to go in incognito mode for JavaScript changes.)

### 3. Deploying your site on GitHub Pages (Optional)
*Note you must have your code on GitHub for this step. If you forked the repo your code is already on GitHub. If you downloaded with "Download ZIP," you will need to create a repo and add the files to it. Here's an [external tutorial](https://handsondataviz.org/create-repo.html) on how to do that with using just the GitHub website.*
Click the 'Settings' Tab on your repository.

Scroll down to the Section labeled 'GitHub Pages.' Then for the Source, click on the 'master' branch to deploy. GitHub reads code from that 'branch' to host your website from.

After clicking save, you should see the link that your app is now live on!

If you make changes to your code after deploying to GitHub pages, all you have to do is push your code to GitHub branch you deployed on and the site will be updated in a few minutes.
